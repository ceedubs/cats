# FunctionK
`FunctionK` is a universal function which operates on kinds. This statement may be easier to understand
if we first step back and talk about ordinary functions.

## Ordinary Functions
Consider the following scala method:

```tut:silent
def first(l: List[Int]): Option[Int] = l.headOption
```

This isn't a particularly helpful method, but it will work as an example. Instead of writing this as a
method, we could have written this as a function _value_:

```tut:silent
val first: List[Int] => Option[Int] = l => l.headOption
```

And here, `=>` is really just some syntactic sugar for `Function1`, so we could also write that as:

```tut:silent
val first: Function1[List[Int], Option[Int]] = l => l.headOption
````

Let's cut through the syntactic sugar even a little bit further. `Function1` isn't really a special type.
It's just a trait that looks something like this:

```tut:silent
// we are calling this `MyFunction1` so we don't collide with the actual `Function1`
trait MyFunction1[A, B] {
  def apply(a: A): B
}
```

So if we didn't mind being a bit verbose, we could have written our function as:

```tut:silent
val first: Function1[List[Int], Option[Int]] = new Function1[List[Int], Option[Int]] {
  def apply(l: List[Int]): Option[Int] = l.headOption
}
```

## Abstracting via Generics

Recall our `first` method:

```tut:silent
def first(l: List[Int]): Option[Int] = l.headOption
```

The astute reader may have noticed that there's really no reason that this method needs to be tied directly to `Int`. We could use generics to make this a bit more general:

```
def first[A](l: List[A]): Option[A] = l.headOption
```

But how would we represent this new `first` method as a `=>`/`Function1` value? We are looking for something like a type of `List[A] => Option[A] forAll A`, but this isn't valid scala syntax. `Function1` isn't quite the right fit, because its `apply` method doesn't take a generic type parameter.

## Higher Kinds to the Rescue

It turns out that we can represent our universal `List` to `Option` transformation with something that looks a bit like `Function1` but
that adds a type parameter to the `apply` method and utilizes higher kinds:

```tut:silent
trait MyFunctionK[F[_], G[_]] {
  def apply[A](fa: F[A]): G[A]
}
```

Cats provides this type as `FunctionK` (we used `MyFunctionK` for our example type to avoid confusion). So now we can write `first` as a `FunctionK[List, Option]` value:

```tut:silent
import cats.arrow.FunctionK

val first: FunctionK[List, Option] = new FunctionK[List, Option] {
  def apply[A](l: List[A]): Option[A] = l.headOption
}
```

## Syntactic Sugar

If the example above looks a bit too verbose for you, the [kind-projector](https://github.com/non/kind-projector)
compiler plugin [provides](https://github.com/non/kind-projector#polymorphic-lambda-values) a more concise syntax.
After adding the plugin to your project, you could write the `first` example as:

```tut:silent
val first: FunctionK[List, Option] = Î»[FunctionK[List, Option]](_.headOption)
```

## Use-cases

`FunctionK` tends to show up when there is abstraction over higher-kinds. For example, interpreters for [free monads](freemonad.html) and [free applicatives](freeapplicative.html) are represented as `FunctionK` instances.
